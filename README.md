# MediPredict - Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

A machine learning model for predicting diseases based on user-input symptoms. This project leverages classification algorithms to provide accurate disease predictions using a dataset of symptoms and corresponding diagnoses.

---

## Features
- ✅ Predicts possible diseases based on input symptoms  
- ✅ Utilizes machine learning classification models  
- ✅ Trained on a structured dataset of symptoms and diseases  
- ✅ Outputs the most probable disease with confidence score  

---

## Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries Used:  
  - pandas – Data manipulation  
  - numpy – Numerical computations  
  - sklearn – Machine learning model training  
  - matplotlib – Data visualization (optional)  

---

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing symptoms and corresponding diseases. The data has been preprocessed and converted into a suitable format for machine learning classification.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies using:

bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib



### Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MediPredict.git
cd MediPredict



### Run the Model
bash
python disease_prediction.py



---

## How It Works
1. The model takes multiple symptoms as input.  
2. It processes the input using a trained classifier (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Naive Bayes).  
3. It predicts the most likely disease and provides the confidence level of the prediction.

## Example Usage
python
from model import predict_disease

symptoms = ["fever", "cough", "fatigue"]

prediction = predict_disease(symptoms)

print(f"Predicted Disease: {prediction}")


---

## Future Enhancements
-  Improve model accuracy with deep learning techniques  
-  Deploy as a web or mobile application for real-time predictions  
-  Integrate a chatbot for interactive disease diagnosis
